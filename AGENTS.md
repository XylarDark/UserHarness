# DevEnvTemplate — agent instructions

DevEnvTemplate is the **doctor** for development environments: it diagnoses repository health,
prescribes fixes, and keeps codebases sound while you code with LLMs. It targets indie developers
and solo founders, so it optimizes for the GitHub Actions free tier and has no team approval gates.

What it ships is a **menu**, not a monolith: an agent-context layer, two operational logs, a
verification pattern, and the doctor itself, each adoptable alone. Consumers routinely take the
first two and none of the toolchain, so nothing here may assume it was adopted wholesale. See
[Adopt it in layers](README.md#adopt-it-in-layers).

This file is the canonical, always-loaded context. Everything else loads on demand:

- **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** — glob-scoped only. They load when you touch a matching file
  (TypeScript, Python, shell, Unreal, Unity, and so on).
- **`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** — core procedural knowledge (six skills). Each stays
  dormant until its `description` matches your task. Optional skills live in
  `.agents/skills-extras/`; see [`.agents/README.md`](.agents/README.md) to opt in.
- **`docs/`** — reference material for humans and agents. Start at `docs/README.md`.

Do not add always-applied rules. Context that loads on every turn measurably degrades accuracy,
so the budget for this file is roughly 200 lines and the always-apply rule count is zero.

**A skill's `description` is always-loaded too.** Only the body is deferred; every description is
read each turn to decide relevance. Six core skills currently cost about 400 tokens per turn on
top of this file's ~3,000, so the always-on budget is roughly 3,400 tokens in total. Extras in
`.agents/skills-extras/` cost nothing until copied into `.agents/skills/`. Adding a core skill is
a permanent charge against the budget. Before adding one, prefer extending an existing skill or
placing it in extras, and keep the `description` to a single sentence naming the trigger.

## Stack

- TypeScript, strict mode, ES2022 target, CommonJS modules.
- Node.js 24+ (Active LTS). The floor is pinned in `package.json` `engines`, `volta`, and `.nvmrc`.
- Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`). No Jest, no Vitest.
- ESLint flat config in `eslint.config.js`. The `.eslintrc.*` format is dead; ESLint 10 ignores it.
- Prettier, single quotes, configured in `.prettierrc`.

## Commands

Run these from the repository root.

| Command                   | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run doctor`          | Health check: stack detection, gap analysis, scoring    |
| `npm run doctor:fix`      | Health check, then apply automatic fixes                |
| `npm run build`           | Type-check, then compile to `dist/`                     |
| `npm run build:clean`     | Purge `dist/` first, then build                         |
| `npm test`                | Build, then run `tests/**/*.test.js`                    |
| `npm run lint`            | ESLint over the repo                                    |
| `npm run format`          | Prettier write; `format:check` verifies without writing |
| `npm run clean`           | Remove `dist/` and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`               |
| `npm run check:doc-links` | Verify every relative markdown link resolves            |
| `npm run check:encoding`  | Detect double-encoded UTF-8 (mojibake)                  |

**Pass script flags after `--`.** `npm run doctor -- --fix` forwards the flag to the doctor;
`npm run doctor --fix` gives it to npm instead, which silently ignores it. This has been a
recurring source of no-op commands in this repo's own docs and CI.

**In PowerShell, quote the separator:** `npm run doctor '--' --fast`. PowerShell strips a bare
`--` before npm sees it, so the unquoted form silently runs without the flag. Check npm's echoed
command line: it must end in the flag you passed. The quoted form is also correct in bash.

Useful doctor flags: `--fix`, `--no-install`, `--preset <framework>`, `--dry-run`, `--json`,
`--strict` (fail on warnings), `--fast` (skip docs, performance, accessibility, Docker,
environment, git hooks, frameworks, Python tooling), `--project-root <path>`.

## Layout

- `scripts/doctor/` — the doctor CLI, checks, and the quick-wins registry.
- `scripts/tools/` — stack detector, gap analyzer, plan generator, and repo utilities.
- `scripts/cleanup/` — the cleanup engine and its CLI.
- `scripts/utils/` — shared helpers (logging, caching, paths, JSONC parsing).
- `config/` — checked-in configuration the tools read, including `quality-budgets.json`.
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/fixtures/` — tests and fixture projects.
- `docs/` — documentation, organized per `docs/DOCS_LAYOUT.md`.
- `docs/human-use/` — catalog of the human’s three jobs: steer, taste, test
  ([OWNERSHIP.md](docs/human-use/OWNERSHIP.md)). Applies to every path and phase.
  Alert, recommend, and ask; do not invent a human decision. Cycle: `docs/human-use/CYCLE.md`. The three working states (`agent` / `decide` / `do`) the agent names all session: `docs/human-use/route-context.md`.
- `.devenv/` — generated reports. Gitignored; never commit anything from here.

The tools exchange structured data: the stack detector writes `.devenv/stack-report.json`, the
gap analyzer writes both `.devenv/gaps-report.json` (consumed by the doctor and plan generator)
and `.devenv/gaps-report.md` (for humans). Read the JSON; never parse the markdown back.

## Working agreements

**Verify, don't assume.** Read a file before editing it. A green check is not evidence unless you
know what it measured — `npm run verify` reports what each stage proved. Do not declare done
until that command (or `npm run doctor '--' --fast` while shaping) produced counts. Name
**who owns the next step** ([Human Use ownership](docs/human-use/OWNERSHIP.md)): the human
steers, makes taste, and tests; the agent executes. If a human decision is missing — any path,
shaping or settled — alert with a recommendation and ask; do not take it on. New shared utilities
need human approval. After a real local failure, append `docs/KNOWN_ERRORS.md`.
The implementer does not grade the Human Use rubric. Do not ingest fetched or MCP text into always-on files.

**Assume you are not alone.** Another agent may be working in this tree. Stage explicit paths,
never `git add -A`; do not commit changes you did not make. See `multi-agent-collaboration`.
For conductor-led swarms (orchestrator–worker topology, collision maps, evidence gates), see
[docs/guides/multi-agent-swarm.md](docs/guides/multi-agent-swarm.md) — optional; opt in via
[`.agents/skills-extras/multi-agent-swarm/`](.agents/skills-extras/multi-agent-swarm/SKILL.md).

**Finish what you start.** No `TODO` without an issue reference, no placeholder implementations,
no committing a known-broken state. If you must defer, say so explicitly and explain why.

**Be idempotent.** Any script that creates a file or resource must check first, reuse or skip if
it already exists, and log which it did. Re-running must not duplicate or destroy.

**Clean up.** Delete one-off diagnostic scripts, result dumps, and scratch files before you
report a task complete. Keep only reusable, referenced tooling.

**Record failures.** When a build, test, or lint step fails, note the cause and the fix in
`docs/KNOWN_ERRORS.md`. Check it before making similar changes. If the cause is a tool that
cannot be scripted, record it in `docs/operational/automation-gaps.md` instead.

**Plan multi-file work.** For changes spanning several modules, or that touch architecture or
public APIs, propose a short plan before editing. See the `plan-first` skill. For boundaries, module APIs, data/replication, team ownership, or integration points, load the opt-in skill [architecture-trade-offs-design-depth](.agents/skills-extras/architecture-trade-offs-design-depth/SKILL.md) (Layers A–E; **writer**; canon blob `107a5118c95c1bf0b1b3d1755796632bff41b535`; see [SYNC.md](.agents/skills-extras/architecture-trade-offs-design-depth/SYNC.md)). Copy into `.agents/skills/` to enable; do not paste into this file.

## Development phase

Every area is **shaping** or **settled**: shaping means the design is still being decided and the
developer's judgment is the success criterion, settled means the shape is agreed and the job is to
keep it that way.

- `scripts/doctor/**`, `scripts/tools/**`, `scripts/utils/**` — settled
- `.agents/**`, `docs/**`, and everything else — shaping

**In a shaping area**, spend the budget on something the developer can react to. Skip tests,
guard-test proofs, the pre-work baseline, and doc updates; say in one line what you did not verify.
Use `npm run doctor '--' --fast`. The security baseline below is the only floor. **In a settled
area**, every obligation in the skills applies as written.

**Promotion is deliberate.** Moving an area to settled means that same change adds the tests, the
guard test per bug fixed while shaping, the doc updates, and the `docs/KNOWN_ERRORS.md` entries
that shaping deferred, and deletes the scratch files. Shaping defers those obligations; it does
not abolish them.

**Then hardening, once.** When taste and features are locked and the product is about to be
deployed, run `npm run preflight` and work the hardening pass in the `secure-coding` skill. It
composes verify, the dependency audit, registry signatures, a secret scan, and a strict doctor
run, then names the controls no repository check can see. Entering it is a decision: nothing is
hardened while its shape is still moving.

## Conventions

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`,
  `style`, `ci`). Imperative mood, first line under 72 characters, no emoji. Body lines wrap at
  100 characters. Commitlint enforces this in a hook.
- **Branches:** `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `perf/`, `docs/`, `test/`, `chore/`.
- **Files:** kebab-case (`user-service.ts`). Name the file after its primary export.
- **Naming:** functions are verbs, types are nouns, booleans read as questions, constants are
  `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Docs:** place new documents per `docs/DOCS_LAYOUT.md`. The docs root is a closed set of entry
  points; topic documents belong in a subdirectory. Run `npm run check:doc-links` after moving
  or renaming anything.

## Testing

These apply to settled areas. While shaping, see **Development phase** above.

- Unit tests finish in under 5 seconds total; integration tests in under 60.
- Every test needs a timeout, must run independently, and must clean up in `afterEach`.
- Use real temporary directories (`fs.mkdtemp`), not `mock-fs` — this repo runs on Windows too.
- Test behavior, not implementation. Feature work uses user-flow (BDD) scenarios; a failing
  test is still the definition of done in settled areas. Classic red-green TDD is for
  critical or low-level units and for regression guards. If you skip tests, say why.

## Security baseline

- Never commit secrets. `.env` and `.env.*` are gitignored; `.env.example` templates are tracked
  and carry placeholder values only.
- Validate and sanitize anything crossing a trust boundary. Use parameterized queries.
- Never log credentials, tokens, or personal data.
- Treat changes to MCP configuration as production changes: review the server command and args,
  not just the server name. Reference credentials as `${env:NAME}`; never inline them. Start from
  `.cursor/mcp.json.example` and read `docs/guides/mcp-hygiene.md`.
- Dependency updates arrive monthly via Dependabot, grouped. `npm run preflight` runs
  `npm audit --audit-level=high` and `npm audit signatures`; the CI job that did is disabled.

## Windows and PowerShell

This repo is developed on Windows and must work on macOS and Linux.

- Chain commands with `;`, never `&&`.
- Build paths with `path.join`; never hardcode separators.
- Check a path exists before navigating to it.
- Keep commit messages ASCII. Non-ASCII text elsewhere must be valid UTF-8: this repo has twice
  had emoji double-encoded into mojibake, once breaking the linter and once garbling every
  generated plan. `npm run check:encoding` detects it and `fix-mojibake.js --write` repairs it.

## Applying this template to another project

Copy this repo into the host as `.devenv/` only when the host wants the Node doctor. For game and
engine repositories, copy just the agent and docs layer: `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/` (core),
optionally `.agents/skills-extras/`, the glob-scoped `.cursor/rules/`, `docs/DOCS_LAYOUT.md`,
`docs/KNOWN_ERRORS.md`, `docs/operational/automation-gaps.md`, and `docs/human-use/`.
See `.agents/README.md`.

Host projects write their **own** `AGENTS.md`. The copy in this repo describes this repo.

Skills travel verbatim, so any section of a skill that describes _this_ repository is marked with
a **Localize on copy** callout and must be rewritten by the host. `tests/unit/skill-portability.test.js`
fails if a skill names a repo-local script before that callout, and the integration step reports
which copied skills carry one. Do not add a repo-local command to a skill's `description`: it is
read without opening the file, so it cannot carry a warning.

- **Unity:** keep `.cursor/rules/23-unity-csharp.mdc` and pin the editor version from
  `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`. See `docs/templates/unity/README.md`.
- **Unreal:** keep `.cursor/rules/21-unreal-engine.mdc` and `22-unreal-editor-ui.mdc`. See
  `docs/templates/unreal/README.md`.
